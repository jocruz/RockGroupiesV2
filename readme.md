# üé® NFT Marketplace with Stripe Integration

## Overview
This project showcases the integration of Stripe for processing payments in an NFT marketplace, enabling users to purchase NFTs through a streamlined checkout process.

## Key Features
- üõí **NFT Purchasing**: Allows users to buy NFTs using Stripe.
- üì¶ **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment processing for NFT transactions.
- üîê **Customer Management**: Creates and updates customer details in Stripe.
- üåê **Thirdweb Integration**: Leverages Thirdweb for NFT minting and management.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: For the front-end and API routes.
- **Stripe**: To handle payment processing.
- **Thirdweb SDK**: For NFT operations on the Polygon blockchain.
- **Chakra UI**: For styling the React components.

## Project Structure

### API Routes
- **`create_customer.ts`**: Creates a Stripe customer or fetches an existing one by email. Checks if the customer has already made a purchase.
- **`stripe_intent.ts`**: Creates a Stripe payment intent for the transaction, allowing users to proceed with the payment.
- **`update_customer.ts`**: Updates the customer's information in Stripe, primarily used for adding metadata like the user's address.
- **`webhook.ts`**: Handles Stripe webhook events to process payment confirmations and triggers NFT minting upon successful payment.

### Front-end Pages
- **`_app.tsx`**: Sets up the ThirdwebProvider and ChakraProvider for the Next.js app.
- **`index.tsx`**: The main page where users sign up, log in, and proceed to the NFT checkout process.

### Components
- **`Checkout.tsx`**: Manages the checkout flow, including displaying NFT information and handling the Stripe payment form.
- **`Form.tsx`**: Renders the Stripe PaymentElement for card information input and payment submission.
- **`Signup.tsx`**: A form for user registration, capturing details like name, email, and phone number before proceeding to payment.
- **`TermsAndConditions.tsx`**: Displays terms and conditions with an accept button to ensure user agreement before making a purchase.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Set up your `.env` file with the necessary Stripe and Thirdweb credentials.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.


## How It Works

1. **User Registration** (`Signup.tsx`): Users input personal information (name, email, phone) which is used by `create_customer.ts` to register them in Stripe. If a customer already exists, it checks for previous purchases to prevent duplication.

2. **Creating Payment Intent** (`stripe_intent.ts`): After registration, the system generates a Stripe payment intent. This process reserves the NFT for purchase and prepares the transaction, setting the stage for payment completion in the `Checkout.tsx` component.

3. **Payment and Checkout** (`Checkout.tsx` & `Form.tsx`): In the checkout phase, users complete the payment process. The Stripe Elements UI is rendered for secure card information entry and transaction authorization.

4. **Finalizing the Transaction** (`webhook.ts`): Stripe sends a webhook event upon successful payment. This endpoint validates the payment and triggers the Thirdweb SDK to mint and allocate the NFT to the purchaser‚Äôs address, completing the NFT acquisition process.

## üöÄ API Endpoints Overview

This section details the backend API endpoints used in the NFT Marketplace project to facilitate user registration, payment processing, and NFT transactions via Stripe and Thirdweb.

### 1. **Create Customer (`create_customer.ts`)**

- **Purpose**: Registers a new customer in Stripe or retrieves an existing one by email.
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Data Handling**:
  - Checks if the customer already exists in Stripe.
  - If not, creates a new customer record with provided details (name, email, phone).
  - Checks previous purchases to prevent duplicate transactions.

```typescript
// Endpoint: /api/create_customer
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
...
```

### 2. **Stripe Intent (`stripe_intent.ts`)**

- **Purpose**: Creates a payment intent in Stripe for processing NFT purchases.
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Features**:
  - Sets the transaction amount and currency.
  - Associates the payment with the customer‚Äôs ID.
  - Restricts payment method to card only.

```typescript
// Endpoint: /api/stripe_intent
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
...
```

### 3. **Update Customer (`update_customer.ts`)**

- **Purpose**: Updates existing customer information in Stripe, particularly the address.
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Functionality**:
  - Receives customer ID and new address data.
  - Updates the customer‚Äôs metadata in Stripe with the new address.

```typescript
// Endpoint: /api/update_customer
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
...
```

### 4. **Webhook (`webhook.ts`)**

- **Purpose**: Handles Stripe webhook events to finalize the NFT purchase process.
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Process**:
  - Validates the event using Stripe‚Äôs signature.
  - On successful payment, interacts with Thirdweb SDK to transfer the NFT to the customer‚Äôs address.

```typescript
// Endpoint: /api/webhook
import Stripe from 'stripe';
import { ThirdwebSDK } from '@thirdweb-dev/sdk';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
...
```

## Implementation Highlights

- Utilizes Stripe‚Äôs robust API for customer and payment management.
- Integrates Thirdweb SDK for seamless NFT minting and transfers.
- Employs webhooks for real-time event handling and process completion.
